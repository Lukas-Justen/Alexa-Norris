# Alexa-Norris

This Alexa Skill project has been developed throughout a Heckathon at Northwestern University. In a group of 4 developers we developed a Alexa skill that tells you Chuck Norris jokes. Due to time constraints and missing basic knowledge of the Alexa platform at the start of the project we missed our goal to developing a restaurant finder.
